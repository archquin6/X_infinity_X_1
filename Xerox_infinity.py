# paradoxically the smaller the X-Y fit data for trend to predicted fit that is compared to test set, the more elaborate the predction

# is an actual thing. Wow, tomorrow is just enough, two days, and good staff lays. Three, and you won t ever be free :P. Four, and your
# prediction is floor. Five, just make it live, and six, what a fix; it would be but its aint....
